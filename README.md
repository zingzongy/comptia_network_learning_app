# CompTIA Network+ Learning & Study App

This is a desktop application built with Tauri and React, designed to help users learn and prepare for the CompTIA Network+ (N10-009) certification exam. The primary goal is to provide a structured learning experience through detailed concept explanations, and eventually, tools for study and reinforcement.

## üåü Key Features

### Current Focus (Learning App Mode):
* **Structured Content:** Network+ concepts organized by chapters/modules based on official CompTIA objectives.
* **D.E.A.K. Learning Model:** Each concept is planned to be explained using:
    * **D**efinition
    * **E**xamples
    * **A**nalogy
    * **K**ey Insights / "What's Special"
* **Sidebar Navigation:** Easy navigation through different sections and topics.
* **Interactive Visualizations (Planned):** Incorporate diagrams and animations to clarify complex networking concepts.
* **Clean User Interface:** Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern look and feel.

### Future Features (Study App Mode):
* **Quiz Mode:** Test knowledge with multiple-choice questions, fill-in-the-blanks, etc.
* **Flashcards:** For quick review of terms, acronyms, and port numbers.
* **Progress Tracking:** Monitor learning progress and quiz performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Framework:** [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) (Rust backend, webview frontend)
* **Frontend UI:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* **Build Tool (Frontend):** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## üöÄ Project Status

**In Active Development.**
Currently focusing on building out the core "Learning App" features and populating content for Network+ N10-009.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started / Development

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm or yarn)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* Tauri development prerequisites (follow the [Tauri setup guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) for your specific OS)

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zingzongy/comptia_network_learning_app.git
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run in development mode:**
    This will start the Vite development server for the frontend and the Tauri application.
    ```bash
    npm run tauri dev
    # or
    yarn tauri dev
    ```

4.  **Build the application:**
    To create a distributable binary for your platform:
    ```bash
    npm run tauri build
    # or
    yarn tauri build
    ```
    The built application will be located in `src-tauri/target/release/`.

## üìÇ Project Structure (Simplified)

* `src/`: Contains the React frontend code (components, pages, assets, styles).
    * `components/`: Reusable React components (e.g., `Sidebar.tsx`, `ContentArea.tsx`).
    * `App.tsx`: Main application component.
    * `main.tsx`: React application entry point.
    * `index.css`: Main CSS file for Tailwind CSS directives and global styles.
* `src-tauri/`: Contains the Rust backend code and Tauri configuration.
    * `tauri.conf.json`: Main Tauri configuration file.
    * `Cargo.toml`: Rust project manifest.
    * `src/main.rs`: Rust application entry point.
* `public/`: Static assets, including `index.html`.
* `tailwind.config.js`: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS.
* `postcss.config.js`: Configuration file for PostCSS (used by Tailwind CSS).
* `.prettierrc.json` (optional): Configuration for Prettier code formatter.

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Goals

* Complete all Network+ N10-009 learning modules with D.E.A.K. structure.
* Implement engaging visualizations for key networking concepts.
* Develop and integrate the "Study App" features:
    * Quiz engine with various question types.
    * Flashcard system with spaced repetition (optional).
    * User progress tracking and analytics.
* Refine UI/UX for an optimal learning experience.

## üôè Acknowledgements

* Content based on CompTIA Network+ (N10-009) exam objectives.
* This project serves as a personal learning tool for both Network+ certification and software development with Tauri, React, and Tailwind CSS.
